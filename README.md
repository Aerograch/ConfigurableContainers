## ConfigurableContainers is a plugin for KSP mod development.
### It is a part of the [AT_Utils](https://github.com/allista/AT_Utils) framework.

It provides a module that allows for creation of container parts for predefined sest of resources **switchable in-flight**. Sets are configured in a separate .cfg file and are intendet to contain similar things like gasses (one set), liquid chemicals (another) and so on.

Another module the ConfigurableContainers provides is the **TankManager** which enables _in-editor_ partitioning of a container, effectively converting it into a set of independent SwitchableTanks.

The third, utility module named **SimpleTextureSwitcher** allows you to cycle through a predefined set of textures for the model or a part of the model, so a container may be easily identified.
