## ConfigurableContainers is a plugin for KSP mod development.
### It is a part of the [AT_Utils](https://github.com/allista/AT_Utils) framework.

It provide a module that allows creation of container parts for a predefined set of resources **switchable in-flight**. Sets are configured in a separate cfg file and are indendet to contain similar things like gasses (one set), liquid chemicals (another) and so on.

Another module the ConfigurableContainers provides is a TankManager which allows in-editor partitioning of container to contain several switchable tanks at the same time (think internal compartmentalization here).

The third, utility module named SimpleTextureSwitcher allows to to cycle through a predefined set of textures for the model or a part of the model; so a container may be easily identified.
