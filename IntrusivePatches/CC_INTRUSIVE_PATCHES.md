#Intrusive Patches of Configurable Containers

Intrusive patches are a set of Module Manager patches that remove other fuel switcher modules (like InterstellarFuelSwitch, FSFuelSwitch) or modify their configs (like removing fuel switching from B9PartSwitch) from many/all parts and replace them with the Configurable Containers' ones.

You should use these with care on a progressed game with many ships in flight, because such transition is never fully reversible. That is, if you include these patches and then decide to remove them, your in-flight ships will not be returned to the _exact_ state they were in before.

So I can't say it emphatically enough:

**!!! BACKUP YOUR SAVES !!!**

Having said that, I want to ensure you I do whatever I can to make the use of these patches safe. And generally it *is* indeed safe.
